# Maji Ndogo Water Access Analysis

## Project Overview
This project, titled **"Maji Ndogo Water Access Analysis,"** focuses on analyzing and improving water access in the Maji Ndogo region using SQL. The primary goals are to assess the distribution of water sources, identify usage patterns, and address infrastructure challenges to enhance water access.

## Project Objectives
- **Analyze Water Source Distribution:** Understand how water sources are distributed across Maji Ndogo.
- **Identify Usage Patterns:** Examine patterns in water usage to identify areas of high and low consumption.
- **Assess Infrastructure Issues:** Evaluate existing infrastructure to identify bottlenecks and potential improvements.

## Skills Utilized
- **SQL Query Writing:** Crafting efficient SQL queries to extract and analyze data.
- **Data Extraction:** Retrieving relevant data from multiple tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing inconsistencies and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Data Transformation:** Modifying data into a usable format for analysis.
- **Data Analysis:** Interpreting the data to draw actionable insights.
- **Creating and Managing Views:** Developing and maintaining views for easier data manipulation and analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the **md_water_services** database, containing over 60,000 unique records and 43 columns. It includes tables related to water sources, usage statistics, and infrastructure details in the Maji Ndogo region. Key tables include:

- **employee**: Contains details of employees involved in the water survey.
- **global_water_access**: Provides data on water access across different regions.
- **location**: Details of locations where water sources are situated.
- **visits**: Records of visits made to various water sources.
- **water_quality**: Data on the quality of water from different sources.
- **water_source**: Information on various water sources, including type and number of people served.
- **well_pollution**: Contains data on pollution tests conducted on wells.

## Project Structure
- **Queries:** SQL queries used for data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **Views:** SQL scripts for creating and managing views to simplify data analysis.
- **Analysis:** Summaries and insights derived from the data, highlighting key findings related to water distribution, usage patterns, and infrastructure issues.
